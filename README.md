This repository is mostly for reference. It contains a simple js client that populates data pulled from a REST service built in Go.

The client was populated using ```create-react-app``` and is mostly stripped out. I may remove it altogether for just some vanilla JS ajax call. Anything fancier sort of defeats the purpose of this reference.
